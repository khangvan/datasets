**THIS DATASETS COPY FROM SEABORN AND ADDMORE DATASET FROM MY DATA TEST**

============

Data repository for [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/) examples.

**This is not a general-purpose data archive.**

This repository exists only to provide a convenient target for the `seaborn.load_dataset` function to download sample datasets from. Its existence makes it easy to document seaborn without confusing things by spending time loading and munging data. However, the datasets may change or be removed at any time if they are no longer useful for the seaborn documentation.


===============
Copy link to google colab to get data set
```python
#read  file from git hub
url = 'copied_raw_GH_link'
df1 = pd.read_csv(url)
# Dataset is now stored in a Pandas Dataframe
```
